# TodoList

## What does my aplication do?

The main purpose of my application is to save and handle to-dos tasks to preview them 
anytime in browser using local storage.
Besides user can clicked above and marked them as Completed to have the chance to delete them
at any time. 


## Built with

- React JS
- Vite
- Animate CSS
- Animista
- LocalStorage


## Why did I used these technologies?

- React gave me the chance to make clearer my code and organise various functionalities into components.

- Vite offered me a quick response time to launch my project up and running.

- Animate CSS was chosen to create an animation called slideDown whenever the tasks
are shown at the application.

- Animista was chosen because I found out an amazing animation called <b>flip-2-hor-bottom-bck</b>
which is triggered every time the task is modified.

- LocalStorage was used it to store all tasks in browser and show them
whenever the application is loaded.
